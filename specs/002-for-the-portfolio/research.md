# Research: Personal Portfolio with Obsidian Dark Theme

**Feature**: 002-for-the-portfolio  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Tasks

### 1. Obsidian Dark Theme Design System
**Task**: Research obsidian dark theme color palette and design principles for portfolio websites

**Decision**: Use a sophisticated dark color palette with obsidian-inspired colors
- Primary: #0D1117 (GitHub dark background)
- Secondary: #161B22 (GitHub dark surface)
- Accent: #58A6FF (GitHub blue)
- Text Primary: #F0F6FC (GitHub light text)
- Text Secondary: #8B949E (GitHub muted text)
- Success: #3FB950 (GitHub green)
- Warning: #D29922 (GitHub orange)
- Error: #F85149 (GitHub red)

**Rationale**: GitHub's dark theme provides excellent contrast ratios, accessibility compliance, and professional appearance that conveys authenticity and ambition. The color palette is battle-tested for developer-focused interfaces.

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Pure black (#000000) - Too harsh, poor accessibility
- Custom dark palette - Less proven, potential accessibility issues
- Material Design dark theme - Too generic, doesn't convey obsidian aesthetic

### 2. Typography for Authentic Personality
**Task**: Research typography choices that convey authenticity, ambition, passion, and obsession

**Decision**: Use Inter font family with strategic font weights
- Primary: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700)
- Headings: Inter 600-700 for authority and ambition
- Body: Inter 400 for readability and authenticity
- Accents: Inter 500 for subtle emphasis

**Rationale**: Inter provides excellent readability, modern appearance, and conveys professionalism while maintaining authenticity. The font family supports the full range of weights needed for hierarchy.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Roboto - Too generic, lacks personality
- Custom fonts - Potential loading performance issues
- System fonts - Inconsistent across platforms

### 3. Next.js 15+ App Router Best Practices
**Task**: Research Next.js 15+ App Router patterns for portfolio websites

**Decision**: Use App Router with server components and client components strategically
- Server components for static content (hero, about, projects)
- Client components for interactive elements (navigation, forms)
- Image optimization with next/image
- Metadata API for SEO
- Route groups for organization

**Rationale**: App Router provides better performance, SEO, and developer experience. Server components reduce client-side JavaScript while maintaining interactivity where needed.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pages Router - Deprecated, less performant
- Static site generation only - Limited interactivity
- Client-side rendering only - Poor SEO and performance

### 4. shadcn/ui Component Selection
**Task**: Research shadcn/ui components suitable for portfolio design

**Decision**: Use core shadcn/ui components with custom styling
- Button: Primary, secondary, ghost variants
- Card: For project showcases
- Badge: For technology tags
- Avatar: For profile photo
- Separator: For section dividers
- Custom components: Hero, project grid, vision quote

**Rationale**: shadcn/ui provides accessible, customizable components that align with modern design principles. Components are built on Radix UI primitives ensuring accessibility compliance.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Material-UI - Too opinionated, doesn't fit obsidian theme
- Chakra UI - Good but less customizable
- Custom components only - Time-intensive, accessibility concerns

### 5. Performance Optimization Strategies
**Task**: Research performance optimization techniques for portfolio websites

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive performance optimization
- Next.js Image optimization with WebP format
- Code splitting with dynamic imports
- Font optimization with next/font
- Static generation where possible
- Bundle analysis and optimization
- Lazy loading for below-the-fold content

**Rationale**: Performance is critical for portfolio websites as they represent professional capabilities. Lighthouse scores directly impact SEO and user experience.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Basic optimization only - Poor Lighthouse scores
- Over-optimization - Development complexity
- Third-party optimization tools - Additional dependencies

### 6. Content Management Strategy
**Task**: Research content management approaches for portfolio websites

**Decision**: Use JSON data files with TypeScript interfaces
- projects.json for project data
- personal-info.json for personal information
- social-links.json for social media links
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Build-time validation

**Rationale**: JSON files provide easy content updates without code changes while maintaining type safety. This approach balances simplicity with maintainability.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Headless CMS - Overkill for personal portfolio
- Hardcoded content - Difficult to update
- Database - Unnecessary complexity for static content

## Research Summary

All research tasks completed successfully. The obsidian dark theme with GitHub-inspired colors, Inter typography, Next.js 15+ App Router, shadcn/ui components, and JSON content management provide a solid foundation for building an authentic, performant portfolio website that meets all constitutional requirements.

**Next Steps**: Proceed to Phase 1 design and contract generation.
