   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a visitor, I want to experience Amaud's authentic personality through a dark, obsidian-themed portfolio that showcases his work, passion, and ambition so I can understand his professional identity and connect with him.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I land on the homepage, **When** I see the obsidian dark theme, **Then** I experience a professional, authentic atmosphere that reflects ambition and passion.
2. **Given** I navigate the site, **When** I use the navbar, **Then** I can quickly access contact, projects, and other sections.
3. **Given** I view the hero section, **When** I see the circular avatar and description, **Then** I understand Amaud's professional identity and can access his social links.
4. **Given** I browse the projects section, **When** I click on a project card, **Then** I navigate to a detailed project page with comprehensive information.
5. **Given** I scroll through the site, **When** I reach the vision quote section, **Then** I feel inspired by Amaud's authentic voice and ambition.
6. **Given** I use the site on any device, **When** the page loads, **Then** the obsidian theme and typography remain consistent and readable.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a project has no image? Display a placeholder that maintains the obsidian theme aesthetic.
- How does the site handle extremely long project descriptions? Text should wrap appropriately without breaking the card layout.
- What happens if social media links are unavailable? Show disabled state with appropriate messaging.
- How does the site handle missing vision quote? Hide the section entirely rather than showing empty space.
