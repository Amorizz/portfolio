# Feature Specification: Personal Portfolio Site

**Feature Branch**: `001-simple-personal-portfolio`  
**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a simple personal page, under my name: a minimal, beautiful, clean and readable portfolio with About, Projects, and prominent links to GitHub and LinkedIn."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a visitor, I want to quickly understand who Amaud is, view selected projects, and access his GitHub and LinkedIn so I can evaluate his work and connect.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given I land on the homepage, When I scan the hero section, Then I see name, short bio, and clear call-to-actions to GitHub and LinkedIn.
2. Given I scroll to Projects, When I view a project card, Then I see title, one-line description, role/stack, and a link (GitHub or live demo).
3. Given I use only the keyboard, When I tab through interactive elements, Then focus is visible and navigation works.
4. Given I use a mobile device, When the page loads, Then content is readable without zoom and layout remains intact.
5. Given images are present, When they load, Then they include descriptive alt text and do not shift layout significantly.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a project lacks a live demo? Show only GitHub link with appropriate label.
- How does the site handle extremely narrow screens (<320px)? Content stacks vertically; no horizontal scroll.
- What happens if external links fail? They open in new tabs; failure does not break page.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The site MUST display name, title/role, and a short bio on the homepage.
- **FR-002**: The site MUST provide prominent links to GitHub and LinkedIn in the hero and footer.
- **FR-003**: The site MUST present a Projects section with at least 3 projects, each with title, short description, role/stack, and link(s).
- **FR-004**: The site MUST be fully navigable via keyboard and show visible focus states for all interactive elements.
- **FR-005**: The site MUST include responsive layout for mobile (‚â§480px), tablet (~768px), and desktop (‚â•1024px).
- **FR-006**: Images MUST include descriptive alt text.
- **FR-007**: External links MUST open in a new tab and use rel attributes to mitigate security risks.
- **FR-008**: The site MUST load quickly with minimal JS/CSS; no invasive analytics.
- **FR-009**: Lighthouse targets for homepage: Performance ‚â• 90, Accessibility ‚â• 95, Best Practices ‚â• 90, SEO ‚â• 90.

*Ambiguities to confirm:*
- **FR-010**: Contact method [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: email link vs. contact form vs. mailto obfuscation].
- **FR-011**: Color palette preferences [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: preferred hues/brand accents].
- **FR-012**: Project list source [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: hard-coded vs. data file].

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- **Project**: title, description, role, stack (tags), linkGitHub, linkLive (optional), image (optional, alt required).
